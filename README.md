A collection of **top-level thinking models** that help you see the essence, break limitations, and make higher-quality decisions.

## ğŸŒŸ Core Thinking Models

### 1. System Thinking
See connections and interactions, not isolated points. Understand the whole picture.

### 2. Essence Thinking
Focus on the root cause instead of surface phenomena. Always ask "why".

### 3. First Principles Thinking
Go back to basic truths and reason up from scratch, instead of relying on assumptions.

### 4. Long-Termism
Prioritize future value over short-term gains. Invest in trends and long horizons.

### 5. Inverse Thinking
Look from the opposite perspective. Challenge common logic to discover hidden opportunities.

### 6. Cross-Disciplinary Thinking
Break boundaries between fields and combine knowledge to create innovative solutions.

## ğŸ”‘ Advanced Thinking Models

### 7. Strategic Thinking
Design clear priorities and pathways with a big-picture perspective.

### 8. Leverage Thinking
Use tools, capital, platforms, or people as multipliers instead of only personal effort.

### 9. Iterative Thinking
Donâ€™t aim for perfection in one shot. Test fast, fail fast, and improve continuously.

### 10. Probabilistic Thinking
Evaluate risks and returns in terms of probability, not just "right or wrong".

### 11. Opportunity Cost Thinking
Recognize trade-offs. Focus resources on the highest-return options.

### 12. Boundary Thinking
Understand limits: what can be done vs. what cannot, to allocate effort wisely.

### 13. Compounding Thinking
Commit to things that accumulate (knowledge, relationships, investments) and let time amplify results.

### 14. Hypothesis-Testing Thinking
Form assumptions, then validate through data and experiments before deciding.

### 15. Empty-Cup Thinking
Stay humble and open-minded. Be ready to unlearn and relearn.

### 16. Contextual Thinking
Adapt decisions to specific scenarios and environments instead of using fixed formulas.

## ğŸ“Œ Summary
Top-level thinking is not about complexity.  
Itâ€™s about **zooming out (bigger picture), zooming in (root cause), and zooming forward (long-term vision)**.  

> Think higher. See deeper. Act smarter.
